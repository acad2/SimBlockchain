# SimBlockchain
This is an implementaion of basic structure of [Blockchain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain) in python.
Classes are used to model the blocks and the blockchain it self, and a basic set of functionality such as various checks and manipulation of the chain is written.

## To run/test/extend the code
use python3 to run  the scripts as some libraries may not be present in python2

## note
This implementation does not take into account "proof of work/stake" hence such an implementation is liable to Sybil attack.
